		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p>My name is Motuma Ayana. I am a Geographic Information Scientist with a specialization in Computer Science. As a group oriented individual passionate about community work, what sets me apart is how my diverse background influences my technical experience in developing connected and collaborative applications.</p>

		<p>My passion for art and design was brought to life during my studies and internship experience on Web GIS and optimization. I was intrigued by the interactive and collaborative systems employed by companies and how they correlate with the development world. Simplicity is a powerful concept that is often difficult to grasp and the most successful projects should not be complex. From my experience, programing goes beyond just the algorithms: it is the art to simplify and organize code, creating the smallest derivative possible to appreciate the uniqueness it brings.</p>

		<p>I currently am a freelance programmer, working on enhancing and transforming existing platforms, raising the bar for creativity, engagement and user-optimized pages. Web development programming is constantly changing and evolving and I hope to continue to explore imaginative techniques, to inspire, aid and bring the best possible work to my clients. In today's workspace and as an individual coming from a diverse background, I am a vital asset bringing in fresh and unique ideas to the table.</p>
